Acknowledgements
===============

Many thanks to Bernd Krolla for his work and documentation on his build of the wordclock (https://rpi-wordclock.readthedocs.io). Original concept and rights by the creators of the QLOCKTWO. Be aware that building a wordclock should not be more than a hobby.

Also thanks to the developers of the micropython port to ESP8266, which makes this cheap multicontroller quite powerful!
