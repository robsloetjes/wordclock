Woodwork

The front of the wordclock shows a matrix of 11x10 characters and 4 dots for indicating the minutes. Behind the characters, regular printing paper takes care of diffusing the light from the leds. Due to the required level of detail, I ordered a laser cut front plate from plywood. The dimensions are 450x450 millimiters. I use a thickness of 2 millimiters to ensure that a wide viewing angle on the clock is possible. See a template in the downloads section.

At the back of the front plate, a raster of slats hold the led strips in place. For a prototype I sawed these slats by hand, but a laser cut is a lot more precise and easier (3mm MDF). See a template in the downloads section. The raster has a height of 18mm. In a prototype I used a height of 15mm, but when de leds are placed 15mm behind the front plate, the middle of a character is a bit more bright than the edges. Therefore I use 18mm thickness now. 

For the outside border I used slats plywood of 4mm thickness. The lengths are 450mm for the left and right side, 450-2x4=442mm for the bottom and 2 times 191mm for the top. In the middle a cutout is present for the 3 buttons. The template for the interior matrix contains parts for holding the buttons which can be glued under this cutout. 

Steps for creating the woodwork:

1. Paint or varnish the front plate and border slats in a color or varnish of your choice.
2. Cover the backside of the front plate with paper. You can fixate it with regular tape. Picture !!!
3. Put together the matrix of slats for the interior and glue it to the back of the front plate. Picture !!!
4. Put together the pieces for the minute-leds and the template for the buttons. Glue them to the back of the front plate. Picture !!!
5. Place all electrical components (see separate chapter)
6. Glue the 4 blocks to the front plate for screwing the back plate to the frame
7. Place the back plate. Make sure you have a cutout for the DC socket, 4 screwholes for screwing the back plate to the glued blocks and 1 hole for hanging the clock to a wall. Picture !!!
