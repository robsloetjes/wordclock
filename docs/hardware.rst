The front of the wordclock shows a matrix of 11x10 characters and 4 dots for indicating the minutes. Behind the characters, regular printing paper takes care of diffusing the light from the leds. Due to the required level of detail, I ordered a laser cut front plate from plywood. The dimensions are 450x450 millimiters. I use a thickness of 2 millimiters to ensure that a wide viewing angle on the clock is possible. See a template in the downloads section.

At the back of the front plate, a raster of slats hold the led strips in place. For a prototype I sawed these slats by hand, but a laser cut is a lot more precise and easier (3mm MDF). See a template in the downloads section. The raster has a height of 18mm. In a prototype I used a height of 15mm, but when de leds are placed 15mm behind the front plate, the middle of a character is a bit more bright than the edges. Therefore I use 18mm thickness now. 

For the outside border I used slats plywood of 4mm thickness. The lengths are 450mm for the left and right side, 450-2x4=442mm for the bottom and 2 times 191mm for the top. In the middle a cutout is present for the 3 buttons. The template for the interior matrix contains parts for holding the buttons which can be glued under this cutout.
