Wordclock based on ESP8266 running Micropython
============

Introduction
=======================================

Here you will find information to build a wordclock inspired by QLOCKTWO (https://qlocktwo.com). The original concept has been adapted by Bernd Krolla into a elaborate python program running on Raspberry PI (https://rpi-wordclock.readthedocs.io). In a search for a more affordable alternative I made thorough alterations (in other words: started over) to run a wordclock program on an ESP8266 WiFi chip, running micropython. Where Krolla's program contains many plugins for showing the weather en even playing Tetris, I focused on the simplicity by only setting and showing the current time. In this documentation I wil give you insight in the process to build such a clock.
